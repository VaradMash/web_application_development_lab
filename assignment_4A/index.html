                        Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for 
                        open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the 
                        Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, 
                        which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier 
                        forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the 
                        name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One 
                        season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both 
                        purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.
                        A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers, 
                        the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing 
                        licence issued by the FIA.[2] The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest 
                        grade-rating issued by the FIA.[2]

                    <p>
                        Charles Marc Hervé Perceval Leclerc[2] (French pronunciation: ​[ʃaʁl ləklɛʁ]; born 16 October 1997) is a Monégasque racing driver, currently racing in Formula One for Scuderia Ferrari. Leclerc won the GP3 Series championship in 2016 and the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017.

Leclerc made his Formula One debut in 2018 for Sauber, a team affiliated with Ferrari, for which he was part of the Ferrari Driver Academy. With Sauber having finished last the year before, Leclerc led the charge to improve its finishing position in the constructors' championship to eighth, and was the higher ranked of the two Sauber drivers.

Starting in 2019 and contracted until the end of the 2024 season, Leclerc drives for Ferrari. He became the second-youngest driver to qualify on pole position in Formula One at the 2019 Bahrain Grand Prix. The 2019 season also saw Leclerc take his first career win in Belgium. He won the Pole Trophy in the 2019 season, becoming the youngest driver to win it.

After two winless seasons with uncompetitive cars, Ferrari recovered to end Leclerc's win drought in the 2022 opener and saw him building an early championship lead.
